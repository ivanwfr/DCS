#### Files functionalities

##### Export.lua
```
    Implements the 5 functions triggered by the launch of a Mission:
    1 - Start - at the start of a mission
    2 - Before video frame action
    3 - After  video frame action
    4 - Each Model Time (second) triggered action
    5 - Stop - at the end of a mission

    - The first function named LuaExportStart is used
    as a way to hookup this custom implementation by
    loading the Export_task.lua file of this project

    - The other 4 functions should be ignored as they 
    will be overridden by the other lua files.
    This way, the Export.lua file will be loaded only once
    by a game session.
    All the other lua files can then be modified and loaded
    afresh when restarting a mission (...or some other event).
    
```
##### Export_task.lua
```
    This is the first file to be loaded when a mission
    starts.

    1 - It contains a list of lines organized as a template
    for the layout of the information exported by the game.

    2 - It imports 3 other files that take care of 
    logging the export process, implement the TCP socket
    connection to the listening process and implement
    the JSON marshalling of the encoded stream of data
    that will be decoded by the listener using the same 
    JSON library.

    3 - Export_task_Start will connect a socket to the
    listener process and imnitiate any provided user
    coroutine.

    4,5 - Pre and post Frame event handlers are left empty
    for the moment.

    6 - Coroutine activity sample sends 3 sampled data
    as an example of wht needs to be done to make that
    work.
